Note, only relatively significant changes to user-visible functionality will be included here. Most recent changes at the top.

## 20241224

Reworked approach to integrating with external node packs. This _shouldn't_ cause any visible changes from a user perspective but please create an issue if you notice anything weird.

## 20241116

* Added the ability to mask both guidance and global changes. See the README section on masks.

## 20241031

* Added the `DiffuseHighParam` node and the ability to connect multiple VAEs, upscale models, noise generators and samplers as well as switch between them per iteration.

## 20241027

* `sigma_offset` YAML parameter removed - you can use schedule overrides to accomplish the same effect (see README).
* Chunked sampling mode added, should make samplers that care about state (i.e. momentum or history like `dpmpp_2m`) work better for guidance steps. May change seeds, you can disable with `chunked_sampling: false` in YAML parameters.
* Added `sigma_dishonesty_factor` and `sigma_dishonesty_factor_guidance` YAML parameters - can be used to increase detail. See README.

## 20241023

* Initial support for rectified flow models (Flux, SD3, SD3.5). Might slightly change seeds for other models.
* Improve contrast adaptive sharpening (hopefully). Will change seeds for workflows using `sharpen_mode: contrast_adaptive`, you can use `sharpen_mode: contrast_adaptive_raw` for the old behavior.

## 20241019

* Added workaround for https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/2833 - may change seeds. You can disable it with `seed_rng: false` in YAML parameters.
* Added `enable_gc` and `enable_cache_clearing` options to YAML parameters.
* Added `use_upscale_model` option to YAML parameters - allows disabling use of an upscale model even when connected.
* Made `highres_sigmas` input optional, now defaults to the same schedule as the official implementation.
* Added `schedule_override` option to YAML parameters, allows internally generating a schedule. See README for details.
